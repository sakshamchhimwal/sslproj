CodeSpace
=========

### What Is CodeSpace All About

Our aim while creating the project was to maximize the visual appeal of
the code for not only the programmer but also for the user who is
intrigued by how to program works.

Features
--------

CodeSpace presents a lot of unique features that come in handy while
writing code.`</br>`{=html} 1. Code Storage`</br>`{=html} - CodeSpace
holds the code efficiently in the form of `Gists` which can be accessed
directly within the website itself it acts as a handy tool to store code
online and provide a hassle-free experience to the user to access and
edit it on the go.`</br>`{=html} 2. CodeExecution`</br>`{=html} - Like
most of the online IDE(s) this also compiles and executes the code but
what most of them lack is code storage in which CodeSpace exceeds
them.`</br>`{=html} 3. CodeVisualisation`</br>`{=html} - This works in
two parts`</br>`{=html} - *Make Playground Form Code:* CodeSpace can
automatically detect the CodePieces and arrange them as CodeBlocks and
provide a visual feedback of how the program executed.`</br>`{=html}
