CodeSpace
=========

### What Is CodeSpace All About

Our aim while creating the project was to maximize the visual appeal of
the code for not only the programmer but also for the user who is
intrigued by how to program works.

Features
--------

CodeSpace presents a lot of unique features that come in handy while
writing code.
 1. Code Storage
	- CodeSpace holds the code efficiently in the form of `Gists` which can be accessed
directly within the website itself it acts as a handy tool to store code
online and provide a hassle-free experience to the user to access and
edit it on the go.
 2. CodeExecution
	- Like most of the online IDE(s) this also compiles and executes the code but
what most of them lack is code storage in which CodeSpace exceeds
them. 
3. CodeVisualisation
	- This works in two parts Make Playground Form Code: CodeSpace can
automatically detect the CodePieces and arrange them as CodeBlocks and
provide a visual feedback of how the program executed.

How to reproduce the CodeSpace in your machine
----------------------------------------------

Either download the zip file of this code and go to the htdocs
directry of your machine and unzip it there or go to the htdocs
directry via command line and type
git clone https://github.com/sakshamchhimwal/sslproj.git.
NOTE: The second option required to have git
installed on your machine
The machine running this
is required to have an *python* installation.

After setup is complete do the following steps:
 - Open the XAMPP control panel and make sure that Apache and SQL server are running.
 - Start your prefered browser and type `http://localhost/sslproj/`
 - You will be greeted with a beautiful home screen.

Features of CodeSpace Python Runner Tool
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- It will tell you the number of the functions(with there parameters), if conditionals, for/while loops, nested loops and conditionls.
- The JS Scripts to tell the varous features of the python code is present, but not implemented due to unavailability of the time.
- The python scripts can also run using your local python installation by tweaking NewGist/Codespace.php file.
- You can see and print any of the gist.
- This tool also work as excellent gists manager as well.
